## Day 1

- Went through "Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch" course from Udacity. Learned about **Perceptrons** and **Neural Networks**. No coding involved as of yet. I have a side project lined up but it is still in the initial planning process. 
- Ran my personal website against Google pagespeed and fixed a few errors.

## Day 2

-  Spent a few hours learning about Perceptrons as Logical operators (AND|OR|NOT) from the Pytorch couse.
- Working on React Helmet for SEO on my site as well. 
Also realized I need to add GraphQL to my to do list in these 100 days. Too little time.

## Day 3

- Learned about 
    1. Error functions
    2. Log loss error functions
    3. Softmax
    4. One - Hot Encoding

<hr />

## Day 4 

Learned about 
- Cross Entropy
- Logistic Regression 

I'll probably take a break on learning tomorrow and go through the concepts once again before proceeding forward.

## Day 5

Revised all the learnings and played around with Pytorch on an upcoming assignment.
