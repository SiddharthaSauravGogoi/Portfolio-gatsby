## Day 1

- Went through "Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch" course from Udacity. Learned about **Perceptrons** and **Neural Networks**. No coding involved as of yet. I have a side project lined up but it is still in the initial planning process. 
- Ran my personal website against Google pagespeed and fixed a few errors.
