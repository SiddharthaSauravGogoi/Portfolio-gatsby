## Day 1

- Went through "Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch" course from Udacity. Learned about **Perceptrons** and **Neural Networks**. No coding involved as of yet. I have a side project lined up but it is still in the initial planning process. 
- Ran my personal website against Google pagespeed and fixed a few errors.

<hr />

## Day 2

-  Spent a few hours learning about Perceptrons as Logical operators (AND|OR|NOT) from the Pytorch couse.
- Working on React Helmet for SEO on my site as well. 
Also realized I need to add GraphQL to my to do list in these 100 days. Too little time.

<hr />

## Day 3

- Learned about 
    1. Error functions
    2. Log loss error functions
    3. Softmax
    4. One - Hot Encoding

<hr />

## Day 4 

Learned about 
- Cross Entropy
- Logistic Regression 

I'll probably take a break on learning tomorrow and go through the concepts once again before proceeding forward.

<hr />

## Day 5

Revised all the learnings and played around with Pytorch on an upcoming assignment.

<hr />

## Day 6

Had to spent some time on an assignment today which I have been working for around 3 days now. 
Just played around with stuff like Batch Normalization, Dropout, Global Average Pooling, Image Augmentation.

<hr />

## Day 7

Spent time learning more about Batch Normalization(why/what/when) and Regularization.

<hr />

## Day 8

Started working on my side project. Wrote up a generic error boundary and fixed dependcy issues.

<hr />

## Day 9

- Learned about Gradient Descent
- Set up SASS folder structure for my side project and set up basic mixins that I've used previously.

<hr />

## Day 10

- Read stuff on L1 and L2 Regularization
- Setup node project architecture for my side project.

<hr />

## Day 11
- Working on an assignment implementing different kinds of regularization techniques.
- Went through Ghost Batch Normalization.

<hr />

## Day 12
I worked on my side project and worked on implementing Github Oauth via passport.js.

<hr />

## Day 13
Set up tests for the frontend. 
Looked up a few tutorials and went ahead with jest and enzyme. I won't be following TDD but I'll write tests for most of the components.

<hr />

## Day 14
Set up tests for the backend today.
It's a bit different from the frontend since I've gone with mocha & chai.

<hr />

## Day 15
Set up tests for the backend today.
It's a bit different from the frontend since I've gone with mocha & chai.

<hr />

## Day 16

- Setup PWA support (Webpack).
- Working on Integrating Google Analytics in my blog.

<hr />

## Day 17 
Worked on build a PWA Weather APP (create-react-app).
Finished
- Theme (Context)
- PWA support
- Error boundaries

<hr />

## Day 18
Still working on the weather app.
Spent quite some time trying to solve an issue hanging around environment variables in React.

<hr />

## Day 19
Adding the finishing touches to the weather app.
