### The Challenge
Starting out #100 Days of Code once again with all the previous failed attempts. The goal of taking up this challenge is to build a habit. Habit of coding (learning new things in my case) daily. One of the reasons why I've taken up this challenge is, well, I'm a very un-organized person. Publicly committing to a challenge like this does put some pressure on me. 

There's a lot of things I'd like to do but at the end of this challenge, I'd like to come out as a technically sound programmer.

### Goals
Right now I'm enrolled in the theschoolof.ai EVA course. So I'm more geared towards learning Computer Vision & Deep Learning first. Of course I'd still like to be more technically adept at topics like DS/Algo, JavaScript(my bread & butter) & CSS.

### To do list (Priorities)

1. Pytorch (Udacity)
2. Machine Learning (FCC, ML Uni)
3. JavaScript 
4. Data Structures & Algorithms
5. Portfolio/Side-projects
6. Deep Learning (EVA - currrently enrolled)

<hr/>

#### Notes
Since my list is aimed towards AI, it's a given that I'd probably not even learn 1% of the topic. I just hope to start in this field and build my career around it. I also have to make sure that I'm technically competent to get into this _highly competitive_ field. Hence, the reason I've decided I'd go through **DS & Algo**, which, might take more than 100 Days to be honest.
