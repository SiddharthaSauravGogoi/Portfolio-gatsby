The goal of taking up this challenge is to build a habit. Habit of coding (learning new things in my case) daily. One of the reasons why I've taken up this challenge is, well, I'm a very un-organized person. Publicly committing to a challenge like this does put some pressure on me. </p>\n<p>There's a lot of things I'd like to do but at the end of this challenge, I'd like to come out as a technically sound programmer.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Right now I'm enrolled in the theschoolof.ai EVA course. So I'm more geared towards learning Computer Vision &#x26; Deep Learning first. Of course I'd still like to be more technically adept at topics like DS/Algo, JavaScript(my bread &#x26; butter) &#x26; CSS. </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>To do list (Priorities)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pytorch (Udacity)</li>\n<li>Machine Learning (FCC, ML Uni)</li>\n<li>JavaScript </li>\n<li>Data Structures &#x26; Algorithms</li>\n<li>Portfolio/Side-projects</li>\n<li>Deep Learning (EVA - currrently enrolled)</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p>Since my list is aimed towards AI, it's a given that I'd probably not even learn 1% of the topic. I just hope to start in this field and build my career around it. I also have to make sure that I'm technically competent to get into this <em>highly competitive</em> field. Hence, the reason I've decided I'd go through <strong>DS &#x26; Algo</strong>, which, might take more than 100 Days to be honest.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting 100 Days of Code Challenge"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog-post-2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
